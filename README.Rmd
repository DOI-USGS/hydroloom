## hydroloom: 

**Install**: `remotes::install_github("doi-usgs/hydroloom")`

**Documentation**: https://doi-usgs.github.io/hydroloom/articles/hydroloom.html

`hydroloom` is a collection of functions to work with hydrologic geospatial fabrics. It has support for attributes that can be seen in:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hydroloom::hydroloom_name_definitions
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
  knitr::kable(data.frame(Name = names(hydroloom::hydroloom_name_definitions), 
                          Definition = unname(hydroloom::hydroloom_name_definitions)))
```

`hydroloom` supports your attribute names that map to the in-built definitions. See [`hydroloom_names()`](https://doi-usgs.github.io/hydroloom/reference/hydroloom_names.html) for more.

`hydroloom` supports both dendritic and non-dendritic networks start at [this vignette](https://doi-usgs.github.io/hydroloom/articles/non-dendritic.html) for more.

`hydroloom` was largely created from components of [nhdplusTools](https://doi.org/10.5066/P97AS8JD):

```
Blodgett, D., Johnson, J.M., 2022, nhdplusTools: Tools for
  Accessing and Working with the NHDPlus,
  https://doi.org/10.5066/P97AS8JD
```

`hydroloom` will support some key functionality of `nhdplusTools`. Some components
of `nhdplusTools` will be deprecated in a future version of the package in favor
of the `hydroloom` implementation. In general, `nhdplusTools` will continue to
support web service functionality and particulars of the NHDPlus data model. 
In contrast, `hydroloom` is intended to be more general and focused specifically 
on hydro fabric data functionality.

`hydroloom` implements algorithms documented in:

### Terminology: 

The following definitions have been used as much as possible throughout the package.  
Terms for rivers:  
**Flowline:** A flowline is an linear geometry that represents a segment of a 
              flowing body of water. Some flowlines have no local drainage area 
              and are never aggregate features.  
**Flowpath:** A flowpath is a linear geometry that represents the connection 
              between a catchment's inlet and its outlet. All flowpaths have a 
              local drainage area and may be aggregates of flowlines.  
**Catchment:** A physiographic unit with zero or one inlets and one outlet. 
               A catchment is represented by one or more partial realizations;
               flowpath, divide, and networks of flowpaths and divides.  
**Catchment Divide:** The polygon boundary that encompasses a catchment.

# Design Notes:
- Hydroloom uses tibble because dplyr verbs for data.frame was dropping the custom hy attributes.
- `hy` class tibble standardizes all attribute names in code.
- graph representation facilitated by `make_index_ids()` and `make_fromids()`
- names are plural when referring to identifiers and singular when referring to a numerical attribute.
