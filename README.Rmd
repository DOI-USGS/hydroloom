## hydroloom:

**Install:** `install.packages("hydroloom")`

Or for latest development: `remotes::install_github("doi-usgs/hydroloom")`

`hydroloom` is a collection of functions to work with hydrologic geospatial fabrics. Hydroloom is designed to provide general hydrologic network functionality for any hydrographic or hydrologic data. The package is intended for developers of workflows and other packages that require low level network and network data manipulation utilities.

Hydroloom has support for attributes that can be seen in:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hydroloom::hydroloom_name_definitions

`hydroloom` supports your attribute names that map to the in-built definitions. See [`hydroloom_names()`](https://doi-usgs.github.io/hydroloom/reference/hydroloom_names.html) for more.

`hydroloom` supports both dendritic and non-dendritic networks start at [this vignette](https://doi-usgs.github.io/hydroloom/articles/non-dendritic.html) for more.

`hydroloom` was largely created from components of [nhdplusTools](https://doi.org/10.5066/P97AS8JD):

```
Blodgett, D., Johnson, J.M., 2022, nhdplusTools: Tools for
  Accessing and Working with the NHDPlus,
  https://doi.org/10.5066/P97AS8JD
```

`hydroloom` will support some key functionality of `nhdplusTools`. Some components
of `nhdplusTools` will be deprecated in a future version of the package in favor
of the `hydroloom` implementation. In general, `nhdplusTools` will continue to
support web service functionality and particulars of the NHDPlus data model.
In contrast, `hydroloom` is intended to be more general and focused specifically
on hydro fabric data functionality.

`hydroloom` implements algorithms documented in:

### Terminology:

The following definitions have been used as much as possible throughout the package.
Terms for rivers:
**Flowline:** A flowline is an linear geometry that represents a segment of a
              flowing body of water. Some flowlines have no local drainage area
              and are never aggregate features.
**Flowpath:** A flowpath is a linear geometry that represents the connection
              between a catchment's inlet and its outlet. All flowpaths have a
              local drainage area and may be aggregates of flowlines.
**Catchment:** A physiographic unit with zero or one inlets and one outlet.
               A catchment is represented by one or more partial realizations;
               flowpath, divide, and networks of flowpaths and divides.
**Catchment Divide:** The polygon boundary that encompasses a catchment.
**Divergence:** The hydrologic nexus (node) where flow diverges. A divergence
                is an abstract location in a hydrologic network.
**Diversion:** A flowline that is below a divergence and is not the primary 
               downstream path. A diversion is a specific feature downstream
               of a divergence.

### Design Notes:

- Hydroloom uses tibble because dplyr verbs for data.frame was dropping the custom hy attributes.
- The `data.table` package is used for some key joins to enhance scalability but dplyr is preferred for clarity.
- `hy` class tibble standardizes all attribute names in code.
- graph representation facilitated by `make_index_ids()`
- names are plural when referring to identifiers and singular when referring to a numerical attribute.
