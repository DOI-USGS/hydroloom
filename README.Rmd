## hydroloom: 

`hydroloom` is a collection of general hydrologic geospatial fabric creation tools.

It was created from generic components of [nhdplusTools](https://doi.org/10.5066/P97AS8JD):

Key terms: 

### Terminology: 

The following definitions have been used as much as possible throughout the package.  
Terms for rivers:  
**Flowline:** A flowline is an linear geometry that represents a segment of a 
              flowing body of water. Some flowlines have no local drainage area 
              and are never aggregate features.
**Flowpath:** A flowpath is a linear geometry that represents the connection 
              between a catchment's inlet and its outlet. All flowpaths have a 
              local drainage area and may be aggregates of flowlines.
**Catchment:** A physiographic unit with zero or one inlets and one outlet. 
               A catchment is represented by one or more partial realizations;
               flowpath, divide, and networks of flowpaths and divides.

Development of hydroloom is underway and rapid change should be expected.

# Design Notes:
- Using tibble because dplyr verbs for data.frame was dropping the custom hy attributes.
- `hy` class tibble standardizes all attribute names in code.
- graph representation facilitated by `make_index_ids()` and `make_fromids()`
- names are plural when referring to idnetifiers and singular when referring to a numerical attribute.
